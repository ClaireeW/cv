  <p>Hi, I am an iOS, Software and Web Developer. I ðŸ’šdark chocolate, coconut and tea. Besides being a quadrilingual (English, French, Chinese & Spanish), a qualified Educator and a backpacker who has visited more than 25 countries, I have started my
    scientific journey
    from 2015. My other â€˜languagesâ€™ include: C++, C#, Java, Javascript, Python and VHDL, along with practice in Atom, Android Studio, Matlab, Visual Studio, Xcode, etc. Learning to learn is always one of my goals in life. My projects during
    undergraduate studies
    included an automated hovercraft with Arduino, an Android Mobile APP with â€˜Tinderâ€™ platform for plant lovers and Home Line Follower Robot with Microcontroller and PCB designed for patients and caretakers, especially in COVID-19 situation.</p>
  <p>As to my extracurriculars, I performed in la fÃªte de la musique (French Music Festival), modelled in photography in network magazine platform LensCulture, volunteered for people with speaking/hearing impairment and joined in AERO MontrÃ©al Case
